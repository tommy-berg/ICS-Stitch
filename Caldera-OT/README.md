# MITRE Calderaâ„¢ with OT Plugin (Modbus) Docker Build

This repository builds a Docker image for MITRE Calderaâ„¢ with an added OT plugin (Modbus). The Dockerfile pulls the Caldera repository, sets up the environment inside Docker, and builds the application with additional plugins.

---

## Overview

MITRE Calderaâ„¢ is a cybersecurity platform designed to automate adversary emulation, assist manual red-teams, and automate incident response. It is built on the [MITRE ATT&CKâ„¢ framework](https://attack.mitre.org/) and is an active research project at MITRE.

The framework consists of two components:
- **Core System:** An asynchronous command-and-control (C2) server with a REST API and web interface.
- **Plugins:** Repositories that expand core capabilities by providing additional functionality, such as agents, reporting, and collections of TTPs.

This Docker build includes the OT plugin (Modbus) to extend Calderaâ€™s functionality for operational technology scenarios.

## Security Notice

ðŸš¨ **Security Notice (17 Feb 2025 10:00 EST):**  
Please pull **v5.1.0** for a recent security patch for [CVE-2025-27364](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/issues/3138).  
**It is critical to update your Caldera instance, especially if you host it on a publicly accessible network.**  
For details, please refer to the vulnerability walkthrough linked above.

## Dockerfile Explanation

The provided `Dockerfile` performs the following steps:

1. **Base Image & Timezone Setup:**  
   Uses Ubuntu 24.04 as the base image and sets the timezone.

2. **Working Directory & Dependencies:**  
   Sets `/usr/src/app` as the working directory and installs necessary system packages such as Python 3, Git, curl, and Golang.

3. **Caldera Repository Clone:**  
   Clones the Caldera repository (branch 5.0.0) recursively.

4. **Plugin Verification:**  
   Checks for the existence of the Stockpile plugin (optional).

5. **Python Virtual Environment:**  
   Creates a Python virtual environment and installs the required Python packages from `requirements.txt`.

6. **OT Plugin Integration (Modbus):**  
   Clones the Modbus plugin repository into `plugins/modbus` and appends its configuration to the local configuration file (`conf/local.yml`).

7. **Additional Dependencies & Plugin Setup:**  
   Installs Go dependencies for the Sandcat plugin, updates agents, and sets up other plugins (Atomic, EMU, etc.).

8. **VueJS Front-End Build:**  
   Installs Node.js and npm to build the VueJS front-end for Caldera, then cleans up unnecessary packages.

9. **Expose Ports:**  
   Exposes ports for HTTP, HTTPS, contact ports, WebSockets, DNS tunneling, SSH tunneling, and FTP C2 channels.

10. **Entry Point:**  
    The image starts the server using:
    ```bash
    python -X dev server.py
    ```

## Build & Run Instructions

### Build the Docker Image

To build the Docker image without using the cache, run:

```bash
docker build --no-cache -t caldera-modbus .
```

### Run the Docker Container
To run the container (mapping port 8888 inside the container to port 80 on your host), use:

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:8888 --name caldera_modbus caldera-modbus
```
Note: The application listens on port 8888 inside the container, even though it is mapped to port 80 on the host.

### Known Issue: YARL URL Parsing Bug
There is a known bug in the YARL component that prohibits hosting Caldera on ports other than 8888. For more details, please refer to the GitHub issue #3138.

### Additional Information
For more details on MITRE Calderaâ„¢, refer to the official repository and documentation provided by MITRE.
